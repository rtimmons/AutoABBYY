Things left to be done on this app:

1.  Add locking to prevent multiple instances of the script from running
    simultaneously.

2.  Instructions for how to attach as a folder-action script

3.  Write to a log file that Console.app will read

4.  Use `Getopt` for configs

5.  Run `cleanup.pl` steps at end (maybe make this configurable)

6.  Test suite

    a.  Mock/invoker for testing
    b.  Sample PDF files for "integration"-style testing

7.  Better error handling and timeout handling

8.  Investigate: Is it still really necessary to run only one instance
    of the Send to OCR app at a time? Can more than one instance run
    with the newest version?
