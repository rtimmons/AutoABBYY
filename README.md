AutoABBYY
=========

Automatically send ScanSnap-ed PDFs to ABBYY OCR

You can run `src/send_to_ocr.pl` to automatically run "Send to
Searchable PDF" on every ScanSnap-created PDF file in Dropbox/Inbox.

The file has configuration options embedded.

Please see the TODO.txt file for things that are left to be done.
